This is an implementation of COOL(Classroom Object-Oriented Language) language compiler, as the project of Course Compiler, Fudan University, 2023 Spring. 

### About COOL
This manual describes the programming language Cool: the Classroom Object-Oriented Language. Cool
is a small language that can be implemented with reasonable effort in a one semester course. Still, Cool
retains many of the features of modern programming languages including objects, static typing, and
automatic memory management.  
You can find the full manual of COOL language in the `cool-manual.pdf` file in the `handouts` directory for more detailed information.

### About our project
There are 5 phases in our project, you can find the detailed description about each phase in the `handouts` directory.  
We had implemented the C++ version of the COOL compiler for all the five stages, you can easily find the source code in the corresponding directory under the `assignments` directory.(PAx for our C++ version) All codes are well documented(doge) and there should be no difficulty reading and understanding them.(I suppose.)   
You can read our report in the root directory of this project, which contains the detailed information about our project and explains about our design about the compiler and test cases.  

### Useful suggestions
- Read the manual carefully before you start coding.  
- Refer to the `handouts` directory for the detailed description of each phase.  

### Hope you enjoy the project and have fun!
